To broadcast to all Turtles simply go into lua mode by typing lua into the command line on a pc/pocket pc

Make sure your pc/pocket pc has a modem connected to it and type rednet.open("whatever side the modem is on")

Now if you have put the startup file on your Turtles you can go to each one and type reboot

All your devices are now connected and ready to broadcast/receive
Go to your pc/pocket pc and if you aren't already go to lua mode (see above for directions)
