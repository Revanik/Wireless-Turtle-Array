# Wireless-Turtle-Array

Overview
--------
For reference the Wireless Turtle Array will be referred to as the WTA from now on

The WTA allows for any number of Turtles to carry out commands wirelessly using a Pocket Computer or a regular computer
There are a couple commands built in to the WTA which are as follows:

Startup - Initializes Turtles in the array (Must be typed manually on each Turtle you wish to use)

Mine - A simple strip mining program (Customizable by typing edit Mine in the terminal)

Return - Returns each Turtle in the WTA to a specified position (Turtles will not compact themselves and will stack on top of each other)

The "Stop All" button on the Main Control's GUI will immediately cease all running commands on any Turtle in the WTA

The "Boot All" button on the Main Control's GUI will connect each Turtle in the WTA to the Main Control (Generally only used during the first setup)

Commands can be run through a Pocket Computer as long as the Pocket computer has a Modem (Ender Modem for infinite range)
The Pocket Computer has no GUI and each command must be run via typing

Commands can only run on the Main Control if it has a Modem (Ender Modem for infinite range)
The Main Control's GUI only contains the 3 Default commands

The Main Control Shows what command each Turtle is performing however depending on the amount of commands being performed the text size may not be able to compensate
and could bug out (Please report any issues with this feature)
